This project is built using modern Android architecture principles, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and testability. Here's a detailed overview:

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):
- **Model**: Represents data and business logic, including repositories and use cases.
- **View**: The UI layer, built with Jetpack Compose, which reacts to state changes.
- **ViewModel**: Handles the business logic and interacts with the model to fetch or update data, exposing it to the view as observable states.

### Clean Architecture:
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the use cases (business logic) that are independent of the framework and platform.
- **Data Layer**: Responsible for data sources like local databases (using Room), remote APIs, and repositories that provide data to the domain layer.
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI-related code and interacts with the ViewModel to display data.

### Kotlin:
A modern, concise programming language preferred for Android development.

### Jetpack Compose:
The UI is built using Jetpack Compose, a declarative UI framework that simplifies UI development by using Kotlin code rather than XML.

### Version Catalog:
Managing dependencies with version catalogs to avoid version conflicts and ensure consistent versions across the project.

### Room:
Used for local database storage, providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access.

### Dependency Injection (DI):
Implemented using Hilt for managing dependencies, improving testability, and simplifying the process of providing objects where needed.

### Base Layer:
A foundational layer with reusable components like base classes, extensions, and utilities to improve consistency and reduce code duplication.

### SOLID Principles:
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help in writing maintainable, scalable, and flexible object-oriented software. Here's a brief explanation of each principle:

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility. By following this principle, you ensure that your classes are focused and easier to maintain or extend without introducing bugs.

2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to an existing class without changing its existing code, which reduces the risk of introducing errors.

3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that the inheritance hierarchy is properly designed and that subclasses are truly substitutable for their base classes.

4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use. It's better to have multiple, smaller interfaces than a large one. This reduces the impact of changes and keeps interfaces focused on specific functionality, making the code more modular and easier to test.

5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Also, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This promotes loose coupling and makes the system more flexible and easier to change without affecting other parts of the system.

By following SOLID principles, code would be easier to test, maintain, and extend over time.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
The project follows the KISS principle to keep things simple, avoiding unnecessary complexity while achieving the desired functionality.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
The project minimizes code duplication by creating reusable components and functions.

### Singleton Pattern:
The Singleton pattern is used for managing shared instances of certain objects to ensure there is only one instance throughout the app lifecycle.

This architecture helps in keeping the project modular, easily testable, and scalable, ultimately improving development efficiency and code maintainability.

**Please proceed by opening the project in Android Studio, running it on a device, and conducting the necessary tests. Thank you.**
