THis project is built using a modern Android architecture that focuses on scalability, maintainability, and testability. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The architecture divides your app into three layers:
  - **Model**: Represents the data and business logic, including repositories and use cases.
  - **View**: The UI layer, built with Jetpack Compose, which reacts to state changes.
  - **ViewModel**: Handles the business logic and interacts with the model to fetch or update data, exposing it to the view as observable states.

- **Clean Architecture**: Ensures a separation of concerns by organizing your code into different layers such as:
  - **Domain Layer**: Contains the use cases (business logic) that are independent of the framework and platform.
  - **Data Layer**: Responsible for data sources like local databases, remote APIs, and repositories that provide data to the domain layer.
  - **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI-related code and interacts with the ViewModel to display data.

- **Kotlin**: A modern, concise language that is the preferred language for Android development.

- **Jetpack Compose**: The UI is built using Jetpack Compose, a declarative UI framework that simplifies UI development by using Kotlin code rather than XML.

- **Version Catalog**: Managing dependencies with version catalogs to avoid version conflicts and ensure consistent versions across the project.

This setup helps in keeping the project modular, easily testable, and scalable while improving development efficiency.
