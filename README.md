This project is built using modern Android architecture principles, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and testability. Here's a detailed overview:

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):
- **Model**: Represents data and business logic, including repositories and use cases.
- **View**: The UI layer, built with Jetpack Compose, which reacts to state changes.
- **ViewModel**: Handles the business logic and interacts with the model to fetch or update data, exposing it to the view as observable states.

### Clean Architecture:
- **Domain Layer**: Contains the use cases (business logic) that are independent of the framework and platform.
- **Data Layer**: Responsible for data sources like local databases (using Room), remote APIs, and repositories that provide data to the domain layer.
- **Presentation Layer**: Contains UI-related code and interacts with the ViewModel to display data.

### Kotlin:
A modern, concise programming language preferred for Android development.

### Jetpack Compose:
The UI is built using Jetpack Compose, a declarative UI framework that simplifies UI development by using Kotlin code rather than XML.

### Version Catalog:
Managing dependencies with version catalogs to avoid version conflicts and ensure consistent versions across the project.

### Room:
Used for local database storage, providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access.

### Dependency Injection (DI):
Implemented using Hilt for managing dependencies, improving testability, and simplifying the process of providing objects where needed.

### Base Layer:
A foundational layer with reusable components like base classes, extensions, and utilities to improve consistency and reduce code duplication.

### SOLID Principles:
The code is designed following the SOLID principles to promote object-oriented design and reduce dependencies, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):
The project follows the KISS principle to keep things simple, avoiding unnecessary complexity while achieving the desired functionality.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
The project minimizes code duplication by creating reusable components and functions.

### Singleton Pattern:
The Singleton pattern is used for managing shared instances of certain objects to ensure there is only one instance throughout the app lifecycle.

This architecture helps in keeping the project modular, easily testable, and scalable, ultimately improving development efficiency and code maintainability.
